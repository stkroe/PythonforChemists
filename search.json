Please choose that method which is suitable for you.\nPython can be install by severals ways:\n\ndirectly by Python official site\n\nthe installation guide can be found under python wiki\n\nor via package manager of your os:\n\ne.g.: sudo apt install python (linux debian) or brew install python (macOS)\n\nor via docker, wsl ect.\nor via a conda or mamba python package and environment managers which have a python interpreter on board and are avaiable for Windows, Linux and macOS [my recomendation]\n\n\n\nPython Package and Environment manager\nThe advantage of using a python package and environment manager is that you have a python interpreter directly on board but you can also directly create different python enviroments and install and remove python packages.\n\nConda\nThere are differerent condainstaller: (Please pay attention which one is suitable for you (https://docs.anaconda.com/distro-or-miniconda/).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nPlease read the Anaconda Terms of Service FAQs and Terms of Service) not every case is free of use.\n\n\n\nAnaconda Distribution is a comprehensive distribution which includes conda and hundreds of preinstalled packages and tools.\nminiconda is the light version of it which contains only conda, python interpreter and few fundamental packages\nminiforge minimal installer for conda and using only the community conda-forge channel\n\n\n\nMamba\nAnother python package and environment managers is mamba. mamba is a reimplementation of conda: - micromamba is a statically linked version of mamba - mambaand it at the moment faster than conda\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRecommondation: micromamba  \nInstall it like it is explained under the micromamba documentation: - https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html\n\n\nPlease install in one of the above explained ways Python and use your preferred searching enging to get more information.\n\n\n\n2. Set up an environment\nIt is often very useful to have different python enviroments for different python projects because of the need of different python package versions.\nYou can use conda or micromamba to create different environments. There exists also other virtual environment manager.\nIn this course the explaination is restricted to micromamba as an example. If you want to use something else there exists tons of information online how to use other programs.\n\nMicromamba: Most important commands are:\nRead for more detail: https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html\nCreating a new virtual environment:\nmicromamba create --name &lt;myenvname&gt;\nInstall new packages:\nmicromamba install &lt;packagename&gt;\nList all environments:\nmicromamba env list\nActivate an environment:\nmicromamba activate &lt;myenvname&gt;\nList all packages of this environment:\nmicromamba list\n\n\n\n3. Usefull packages for Data Analyse and Visualization:\n\nmatplotlib - data visualization library\nnumpy - numerical library\nscipy - scientific library\npandas - data manipulation library\nseaborn - data visualization library\nscikit-learn - machine learning library\nstatsmodels - statistical library\njupyter-notebook/jupyterlab - interactive computing environment\nipykernel - IPython Kernel for Jupyter\npip - package installer for python instead of conda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRecommendation  Use yml-file with all needed packages and configurations:\n\n\nSave this in a environment.yml file:\nname: myenv\nchannels:\n - conda-forge\ndependencies:\n - python=3.12\n - pandas\n - numpy\n - matplotlib\n - jupyterlab\n - scikit-learn\n - scipy\n - pip\n - ipykernel\n - seaborn\n - statsmodels\nand create an environment with this specific packages:\nmicromamba env create -f environment.yml\nTest your installation by opening the interactive python mode by typing in your terminal (Linux, macOS) / comand prompt (Windows):\npython\nthen something like this should be opened in your terminal (Linux, macOS) / comand prompt (Windows)\nPython 3.12.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Oct 4 2024, 15:57:01) [Clang 17.0.6 ] on darwin Type “help”, “copyright”, “credits” or “license” for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt;\nthen type:\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\nIf this works your installation was successful!\n\n\n4. Choose an editor\nAfter you installed python successfully you need a editor for writing your Python programs. Technical you could use everything where you can write text but it is not really purposeful.\nAn editor with syntax highlighting, code completion and debugging is very useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRecommendation: Visual Studio Code\n\n\n\nOther editors:\n\nSpyder https://www.spyder-ide.org/\nPyCharm (JetBrains) https://www.jetbrains.com/products/compare/?product=pycharm&product=pycharm-ce\nJupyter Notebook https://jupyter.org/ https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks\nJupyter Lab https://jupyter.org/ https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks etc.\n\n\n\nPython extension for VS Code:\n\nPython from Microsoft,\nPylance from Microsoft\nand Jupyter from Microsoft (optional it is only needed if you want to use Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code)\n\nAlternatively you can use a Jupyter Notebook (*.ipynb) to execute code.\nWrite the code in a cell and execute it by pressing the run button.\nAdvantage of using Jupyter Notebooks: - The code can run cell by cell and the output is directly shown below the cell. - Further you can write text and equations in markdown cells. - Jupyter Notebooks can also handle different programming languages like Ror Julia. - Therefore it is very popular in the data science community.\nJupyter Notebooks can be used in VS Code, Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.\n\nIn this course all exercises are provided as Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n\n\n\n6. Test your setup\n\nopen your editor\nopen a new file and save this file as helloworld.py\nwrite your first test program:\n\n\n\nHello World!\n\n\n\nexecute your program by using your IDE/Editor\nor using command line in the terminal (Linux/MacOS) / command prompt under Windows.\n\ncd /path/to/file\npython helloworld.py\nThe ouput should be: “Hello World!”.\nIf you are using Jupyter Notebook you can also write this code in a cell and execute it by pressing the run button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations\n\n\n\nYou have successfully set up python!!",

(Requires API key, which can be obtained by registering on the website.)\n\nRCSB PDB Protein Data Bank, you can use the rcsb library.\nPubChem, you can use the pubchempy library.\n\n… and many more.\nIf you use APIs please read the documentation of the API to understand how to access the data. And make sure to respect the API usage policy and database terms of use.",

    "section": "Which data formats do you use?",
    "text": "Which data formats do you use?\nData can be stored in various data formats, such as: - Plain Text files (e.g. CSV, DAT, TXT) - Text files with structure (e.g. JSON, XML) - Spreadsheet files - Binary files (e.g. HDF5, Parquet, NetCDF,Feather, Pickle, npy, etc.) - Databases - chemical and molecular data formats (e.g. XYZ, CIF, PDB, etc.) - etc.\n\nPlain Text Files\nA text file often contains a header with the names of the columns and then the data in rows. Columns can be seperated by different delimiters (spaces, ,, ;, tabs, …).  For example, a file with data from an experiment could look like this:\nTime/s  Temperature/°C\n0         20\n10        21\n...     ...\n\n\nJSON or XML\nJSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. Data is structured in a key-value format, so that both humans and machines can read it easily.  For example, a JSON file with the same data as above could look like this:\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    {\"Time\": 0, \"Temperature\": 20},\n    {\"Time\": 10, \"Temperature\": 21},\n    ...\n  ]\n}\nXML stands for Extensible Markup Language. It is also designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable.  For example, an XML file with the same data as above could look like this:\n&lt;data&gt;\n  &lt;measurement&gt;\n    &lt;Time&gt;0&lt;/Time&gt;\n    &lt;Temperature&gt;20&lt;/Temperature&gt;\n  &lt;/measurement&gt;\n  &lt;measurement&gt;\n    &lt;Time&gt;10&lt;/Time&gt;\n    &lt;Temperature&gt;21&lt;/Temperature&gt;\n  &lt;/measurement&gt;\n  ...\n\n### Binary Files\n\nData is stored in a binary format and can be read with specific libraries. It is often used for large datasets, as it is more efficient than plain text files. The computer is able to read and write binary files faster than text files. &lt;br&gt; Some common binary file formats are:\n\n- [**HDF5**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format): Hierarchical Data Format, used for large datasets\n- [**Parquet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Parquet): Columnar storage format, used for big data\n- [**NetCDF**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetCDF): Network Common Data Form, array-orriented, often for geoscience data\n- [**Feather**](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html): a fast column-based serialization for data frames, initially designed for R and Python, helps to share data between languages\n- [**Pickle**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html): Python-specific format, used for serializing Python objects\n- [**npy**](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.lib.format.html): Numpy-specific format, used for saving numpy arrays\n\nHere is a list of comparison of binary file formats: [Comparison of data serialization formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_data-serialization_formats)\n\n### Databases\n\nDatabases are designed for big data storage. The advantage of databases is that they can be queried and updated easily. There are different types of databases, such as:\n- **[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)** databases (e.g. SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL)\n- **[NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL)** databases (e.g. MongoDB)\n- **[Graph databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database#List_of_graph_databases)**\n- **[Time series databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database)**\n\n### Chemical and Molecular Data Formats\n\nThere are specific data formats for chemical and molecular data, such as:\n- **[XYZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_file_format)**: Cartesian coordinates of atoms\n- **[CIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_Information_File)**: Crystallographic Information File, used for crystallographic data\n- **[PDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank_(file_format))**: Protein Data Bank, used for protein structures\n- **[MOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_table_file)**: Molecule file format, used for chemical structures\n- **[SDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_table_file)**: Structure Data File, used for chemical structures\n- **[SMILES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system)**: Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System, used for chemical structures\n- **[InChI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Chemical_Identifier)**: International Chemical Identifier, used for chemical structures\netc.\n\n\n### Other Data Formats\n- [**Images**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats): Images can be stored in different formats, such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, GIF, etc.\n- [**Audio**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_file_format): Audio files can be stored in different formats, such as MP3, WAV, FLAC, etc.\n- [**Video**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_file_format): Video files can be stored in different formats, such as MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.\n\n## What type of data do you have?\n\nNext what do you have to consider is the types of your data. \n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA[Types of Data] --&gt; B[Numerical]\nA --&gt; C[Categorical]\nB --&gt; D[Discrete]\nB --&gt; E[Continuous]\nC --&gt; F[Ordinal]\nC --&gt; G[Nominal]\nDepending on the type of data analysis could be different.\n\n\n\nNumerical Data\nNumerical data is data that is expressed with numbers. It can be further divided into two types: - Discrete: Data that can only take certain values (e.g. integers) - Continuous: Data that can take any value within a certain range (e.g. real numbers)\nFor example, - measured temperature over time -&gt; continuous - number of chemical substances, which are measured -&gt; discrete\n\n\nCategorical Data\nCategorial means that data is divided into categories. It can be further divided into two types: - Ordinal: Data that has a specific order or ranking - Nominal: Data that has no specific order or ranking\nFor example, - blood type -&gt; nominal {A, B, AB, O} - chemical function group -&gt; nominal {alcohol, ketone, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, etc.} - purity of a substance -&gt; ordinal {low, medium, high} - hardness of a material -&gt; ordinal {soft, medium, hard}",
