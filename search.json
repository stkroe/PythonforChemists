If you have no or only very vague knowledge than please follow the beginner path otherwise the advanced path. If you want to really challenge you try also the challenging parts.\n\nThe beginner path concentrates on first contact in python.\nIn the advanced path you get a deeper dive into different libaries and specialized visualization plots.\nThe challenging part is for those who wants to explore advanced topics and complex data visualization techniques. This path will challenge you with more difficult exercises and in-depth analysis.\n\nEvery chapter provides examples related to chemistry and material science. At the end of each part, there are exercises to test your understanding and reinforce the concepts learned. These exercises are designed to be practical and relevant to real-world scenarios in chemistry and materials science.",

Please choose that method which is suitable for you.\nPython can be install by severals ways:\n\ndirectly by Python official site\n\nthe installation guide can be found under python wiki\n\nor via package manager of your os:\n\ne.g.: sudo apt install python (linux debian) or brew install python (macOS)\n\nor via docker, wsl ect.\nor via a conda or mamba python package and environment managers which have a python interpreter on board and are avaiable for Windows, Linux and macOS [my recomendation]\n\n\n\nPython Package and Environment manager\nThe advantage of using a python package and environment manager is that you have a python interpreter directly on board but you can also directly create different python enviroments and install and remove python packages.\n\nConda\nThere are differerent condainstaller: (Please pay attention which one is suitable for you (https://docs.anaconda.com/distro-or-miniconda/).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nPlease read the Anaconda Terms of Service FAQs and Terms of Service) not every case is free of use.\n\n\n\nAnaconda Distribution is a comprehensive distribution which includes conda and hundreds of preinstalled packages and tools.\nminiconda is the light version of it which contains only conda, python interpreter and few fundamental packages\nminiforge minimal installer for conda and using only the community conda-forge channel\n\n\n\nMamba\nAnother python package and environment managers is mamba. mamba is a reimplementation of conda: - micromamba is a statically linked version of mamba - mambaand it at the moment faster than conda\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRecommondation: micromamba  \nInstall it like it is explained under the micromamba documentation: - https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html\n\n\nPlease install in one of the above explained ways Python and use your preferred searching enging to get more information.\n\n\n\n2. Set up an environment\nIt is often very useful to have different python enviroments for different python projects because of the need of different python package versions.\nYou can use conda or micromamba to create different environments. There exists also other virtual environment manager.\nIn this course the explaination is restricted to micromamba as an example. If you want to use something else there exists tons of information online how to use other programs.\n\nMicromamba: Most important commands are:\nRead for more detail: https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html\nCreating a new virtual environment:\nmicromamba create --name &lt;myenvname&gt;\nInstall new packages:\nmicromamba install &lt;packagename&gt;\nList all environments:\nmicromamba env list\nActivate an environment:\nmicromamba activate &lt;myenvname&gt;\nList all packages of this environment:\nmicromamba list\n\n\n\n3. Usefull packages for Data Analyse and Visualization:\n\nmatplotlib - data visualization library\nnumpy - numerical library\nscipy - scientific library\npandas - data manipulation library\nseaborn - data visualization library\nscikit-learn - machine learning library\nstatsmodels - statistical library\njupyter-notebook/jupyterlab - interactive computing environment\nipykernel - IPython Kernel for Jupyter\npip - package installer for python instead of conda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRecommendation  Use yml-file with all needed packages and configurations:\n\n\nSave this in a environment.yml file:\nname: myenv\nchannels:\n - conda-forge\ndependencies:\n - python=3.12\n - pandas\n - numpy\n - matplotlib\n - jupyterlab\n - scikit-learn\n - scipy\n - pip\n - ipykernel\n - seaborn\n - statsmodels\nand create an environment with this specific packages:\nmicromamba env create -f environment.yml\nTest your installation by opening the interactive python mode by typing in your terminal (Linux, macOS) / comand prompt (Windows):\npython\nthen something like this should be opened in your terminal (Linux, macOS) / comand prompt (Windows)\nPython 3.12.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Oct 4 2024, 15:57:01) [Clang 17.0.6 ] on darwin Type “help”, “copyright”, “credits” or “license” for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt;\nthen type:\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\nIf this works your installation was successful!\n\n\n4. Choose an editor\nAfter you installed python successfully you need a editor for writing your Python programs. Technical you could use everything where you can write text but it is not really purposeful.\nAn editor with syntax highlighting, code completion and debugging is very useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRecommendation: Visual Studio Code\n\n\n\nOther editors:\n\nSpyder https://www.spyder-ide.org/\nPyCharm (JetBrains) https://www.jetbrains.com/products/compare/?product=pycharm&product=pycharm-ce\nJupyter Notebook https://jupyter.org/ https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks\nJupyter Lab https://jupyter.org/ https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks etc.\n\n\n\nPython extension for VS Code:\n\nPython from Microsoft,\nPylance from Microsoft\nand Jupyter from Microsoft (optional it is only needed if you want to use Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code)\n\nAlternatively you can use a Jupyter Notebook (*.ipynb) to execute code.\nWrite the code in a cell and execute it by pressing the run button.\nAdvantage of using Jupyter Notebooks: - The code can run cell by cell and the output is directly shown below the cell. - Further you can write text and equations in markdown cells. - Jupyter Notebooks can also handle different programming languages like Ror Julia. - Therefore it is very popular in the data science community.\nJupyter Notebooks can be used in VS Code, Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.\n\nIn this course all exercises are provided as Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n\n\n\n6. Test your setup\n\nopen your editor\nopen a new file and save this file as helloworld.py\nwrite your first test program:\n\n\n\nHello World!\n\n\n\nexecute your program by using your IDE/Editor\nor using command line in the terminal (Linux/MacOS) / command prompt under Windows.\n\ncd /path/to/file\npython helloworld.py\nThe ouput should be: “Hello World!”.\nIf you are using Jupyter Notebook you can also write this code in a cell and execute it by pressing the run button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations\n\n\n\nYou have successfully set up python!!",
