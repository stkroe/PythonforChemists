    "section": "Which data formats do you use?",
    "text": "Which data formats do you use?\nData can be stored in various data formats, such as: - Plain Text files (e.g. CSV, DAT, TXT) - Text files with structure (e.g. JSON, XML) - Spreadsheet files - Binary files (e.g. HDF5, Parquet, NetCDF,Feather, Pickle, npy, etc.) - Databases - chemical and molecular data formats (e.g. XYZ, CIF, PDB, etc.) - etc.\n\nPlain Text Files\nA text file often contains a header with the names of the columns and then the data in rows. Columns can be seperated by different delimiters (spaces, ,, ;, tabs, …).  For example, a file with data from an experiment could look like this:\nTime/s  Temperature/°C\n0         20\n10        21\n...     ...\n\n\n\nJSON or XML\nJSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. Data is structured in a key-value format, so that both humans and machines can read it easily.  For example, a JSON file with the same data as above could look like this:\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    {\"Time\": 0, \"Temperature\": 20},\n    {\"Time\": 10, \"Temperature\": 21},\n    ...\n  ]\n}\nXML stands for Extensible Markup Language. It is also designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable.  For example, an XML file with the same data as above could look like this:\n&lt;data&gt;\n  &lt;measurement&gt;\n    &lt;Time&gt;0&lt;/Time&gt;\n    &lt;Temperature&gt;20&lt;/Temperature&gt;\n  &lt;/measurement&gt;\n  &lt;measurement&gt;\n    &lt;Time&gt;10&lt;/Time&gt;\n    &lt;Temperature&gt;21&lt;/Temperature&gt;\n  &lt;/measurement&gt;\n  ...\n\n\nBinary Files\nData is stored in a binary format and can be read with specific libraries. It is often used for large datasets, as it is more efficient than plain text files. The computer is able to read and write binary files faster than text files.  Some common binary file formats are:\n\nHDF5: Hierarchical Data Format, used for large datasets\nParquet: Columnar storage format, used for big data\nNetCDF: Network Common Data Form, array-orriented, often for geoscience data\nFeather: a fast column-based serialization for data frames, initially designed for R and Python, helps to share data between languages\nPickle: Python-specific format, used for serializing Python objects\nnpy: Numpy-specific format, used for saving numpy arrays\n\nHere is a list of comparison of binary file formats: Comparison of data serialization formats\n\n\nDatabases\nDatabases are designed for big data storage. The advantage of databases is that they can be queried and updated easily. There are different types of databases, such as: - SQL databases (e.g. SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) - NoSQL databases (e.g. MongoDB) - Graph databases - Time series databases\n\n\nChemical and Molecular Data Formats\nThere are specific data formats for chemical and molecular data, such as:\n\nXYZ: Cartesian coordinates of atoms\nCIF: Crystallographic Information File, used for crystallographic data\nPDB: Protein Data Bank, used for protein structures\nMOL: Molecule file format, used for chemical structures\nSDF: Structure Data File, used for chemical structures\nSMILES: Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System, used for chemical structures\nInChI: International Chemical Identifier, used for chemical structures\nnmrML: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Markup Language, used for NMR data\nNMReDATA: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Electronic Data Aggregation, used for NMR data\nJCAMP-DX: Joint Committee on Atomic and Molecular Physical Data, used for spectroscopy data\nmzML: Mass Spectrometry Markup Language, used for mass spectrometry data\naniml: Analytical Information Markup Language, used for analytical data\nFASTA: used for DNA and protein sequences\n\netc.\n\n\nOther Data Formats\n\nImages: Images can be stored in different formats, such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, GIF, etc.\nAudio: Audio files can be stored in different formats, such as MP3, WAV, FLAC, etc.\nVideo: Video files can be stored in different formats, such as MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.",

So you can not read a file with strings and numbers in the same file.\nIf you try to read a file with a header row, you will get an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can specify the header row using the skiprows parameter. If you want to skip one row, the skiprows=1 parameter is set at 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the data is read correctly. You can see that the data is read as a numpy array and not as a DataFrame. This can be a disadvantage if you want to use the data as a DataFrame but an advantage if you want to use numpy functions to process the data.\nIf you have data with whitespace, you do not need to specify the delimiterparamter because the default is whitespace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngenfromtxt() gives you more flexibility to read files with missing values.\nFirst using the loadtxt() function, you get an error because of the missing values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you try to read the file with an empty entrance at row 22, you wil get still an error with the genfromtxt() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut why? What do you think is the reason for the error?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason is that the genfromtxt() function expects the same number of columns in each row. The delimiter is set default to whitespace. But if you have a missing value, the function expects a value. An error is raised because at row 22 the function is detecting only one column due to the missing value.\n\n\n\nHow can you solve this problem?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can NOT solve this problem with the genfromtxt() function if you have missing values and delimiter is whitespace.

The minimum temperature is 279 K and the maximum temperature is 316 K. Further the 25% quantile is 294 K, the 50% quantile is 298 K and the 75% quantile is 302 K.

If you want to create a new figure, use plt.figure() before plt.plot().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Adjust the plot.\nThe plot() function takes the following arguments: - x-axis data points - y-axis data points - color: hex, or color name (e.g., ‘red’, ‘blue’,‘black’), abbreviated (e.g., ‘r’, ‘b’,‘k’) - linestyle: ‘-’, ‘–’, ‘-.’, ‘:’ or “solid”, “dashed”, “dashdot”, “dotted” - marker: ‘o’, ‘x’, ‘+’, ’*‘, ’s’, ‘d’, ‘^’, ‘v’, ‘&gt;’, ‘&lt;’, ‘p’, ‘h’ - linewidth - width of the line - alpha - transparency of the line - markerfacecolor - color of the marker face - markersize - size of the marker - label - label for the data points\nYou have to call plt.legend() to show the labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Adust the figure\nThis plot figure can be adjusted by changing the figure size, title, labels, and so on.\n\nplt.xlabel(): Set the x-axis label of the current axis.\nplt.ylabel(): Set the y-axis label of the current axis.\nplt.title(): Set a title for the axes.\nplt.legend(): Place a legend on the axes.\nplt.grid(): Configure the grid lines.\nplt.xlim(): Get or set the x-limits of the current axes.\nplt.ylim(): Get or set the y-limits of the current axes.\nplt.xticks(): Get or set the current tick locations and labels of the x-axis.\nplt.yticks(): Get or set the current tick locations and labels of the y-axis.\nplt.figure(): Create a new figure.\nplt.show(): Display a figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating multiple plots\nYou can create multiple plots in the same figure by using the subplot() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets try to create 4x3 subplots with specific adjustments. -plt.subplots(4, 3): create 4x3 subplots -figsize=(3, 4): set the figure size to 3x4 inches -sharex=True: all subplots share the x-axis -sharey=True: all subplots share the y-axis -constraint_layout=True: automatically adjust the subplot parameters to give the specified padding around the subplots -gridspec_kw={‘hspace’: 0.5, ‘wspace’: 0.5}`: set the horizontal and vertical space between the subplots to 0.5 inches\nPlay with the code below to understand the different parameters:\n\nviewof figx = Inputs.range(\n  [1, 10], \n  {value: 5, step: 0.5, label: \"Figure x-size:\"}\n)\nviewof figy = Inputs.range(\n  [1, 10], \n  {value: 5, step: 0.5, label: \"Figure y-size:\"}\n)\nviewof constrained = Inputs.select([\"True\", \"False\"], {label: \"Select an option:\"})\nviewof dpi = Inputs.range(\n  [70, 100], \n  {value:75, step:5 , label: \"Dpi:\"}\n)\nviewof space_h = Inputs.range(\n  [0.1, 1], \n  {value: 0.5, step: 0.05, label: \"horizonatal space:\"}\n)\nviewof space_w = Inputs.range(\n  [0.1, 1], \n  {value: 0.5, step: 0.05, label: \"width space:\"}\n)",
