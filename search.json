    "text": "What can you expect from this course\n\nThis course wants to show you the advantage of using a programming language for data analyzing and visualization in chemistry and material science in comparision to gui-based softwares.\nThe course will give you a very brief introduction to Python and its libraries.\nThe main focus will be on the libraries numpy, pandas, pandas, scipy, matplotlib and seaborn for data analyzing and visualization.\nThe course is organized interactivly. You will get the chance to practice with exercises.\nUpon successful completion of this course, participants will have acquired a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental components of Python and the key packages necessary for the analysis and presentation of their own research data.\nYou can test your knowledge by an exam example at the end of this course.",

Most chapters are containing an introduction for every one, a beginner, an advanced and a challenging section. If you have no or only very vague knowldege than please follow the beginner path otherwise the advanced path. If you want to really challenge you please follow the hard-mode path.\n\nThe beginner path concentrates on first contact in python.\nIn the advanced path you get a deeper dive into different libaries and specialized visualization plots.\nThe hard-mode is for those who wants to explore advanced topics and complex data visualization techniques. This path will challenge you with more difficult exercises and in-depth analysis.",
