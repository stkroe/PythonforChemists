    "Depending on your research field, you have data in different formats. For example, in the field of bioinformatics, you have data in FASTA format. In this notebook, I will show you how to import data in FASTA format.\n",
    "\n",
    "FASTA format is a text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or amino acid (protein) sequences, in which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes. A sequence in FASTA format begins with a single-line description, followed by lines of sequence data. The description line is distinguished from the sequence data by a greater-than (\">\") symbol in the first column. It is recommended that all lines of text be shorter than 80 characters in length.\n",
