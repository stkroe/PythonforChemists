## Introduction 

What we will discuss today:
**Introduction to Python - Essentials**

- [Introduction to Python](course/chapters/Essentials/Introduction.qmd)
- [What is Python?](course/chapters/Essentials/WhatIsPython.qmd)
- [Python Basics](course/chapters/Python/Basics.qmd)
- [Python Libraries](course/chapters/Python/BasicsModules.qmd)


## Lecture 1 

**Data Handling and Preprocessing**

- [Data Collection](course/chapters/DHP/DataCollection.qmd)
- [Data Import](course/chapters/DHP/SimpleDataImport.qmd)
- [Data Inspection](course/chapters/DHP/DataInspection.qmd)

**First Data Visualization Techniques - Datra Visualization 1**

- [Data Visualization](course/chapters/Plots/DataVisualization.qmd)
- [Simple Plots](course/chapters/Plots/SimplePlots.qmd)

## Organization of the course

All educational information of the course can be found on the website: [https://stkroe.github.io/PythonforChemists/](https://stkroe.github.io/PythonforChemists/)

**Lecture Blocks**: will take araound 2h hours (first day +1h because of the introduction):
- Lecture Blocks explains different concepts and tools for data analysis and visualization 
- We try to keep the lectures as interactive as possible.
- Every lecture with code can be opened as Jupyter notebook locally {{< bi journal >}} or in Google Colab{{< bi laptop >}}.
- Also for the lectures there are smaller exercises to practice the learned concepts.
- The exercises are not mandatory but we highly recommend to do them.

- For people who are more advanced in Python, they can skip the Essentials and the parts that they already know.
- They can concentrate more on the exercises and go though the lectures in a more self-paced way.

## Organization of the course

**Exercise Blocks**: will take around 2-3 hourse depending on the length of the exercises.
- Exercise Blocks are meant to practice the learned concepts and tools.
- This exercises try to be close to real life examples.
- First you get some time to solve the exercises on your own.
- After that we will go through the exercises together.

**Final Exam**: will take around 2 hours.
- The final exam will be (2-3) exercises (depending how far we get) that you have to solve on your own.
- You should create from the given data publications ready figures.
- This figures are the basis for the final exam.
