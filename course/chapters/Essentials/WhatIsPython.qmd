## Short History of Python {.unnumbered}


(see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python) for more details)


- 1989: the beginning of python
- 1991: Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer and father of Python, implemented and published the first version of Python.
- Fun fact: The name Python came from the show Monty Python's Flying Circus.
- 1994: Python 1.0 was released
- 2000: Python 2.0 was released
- 2008: Python 3.0 was released with new syntax and features
- Important: **python3 to python2 is backward incompatible** *e.g.* `print("Hello World")` python3 and `print "Hello World"` python2. 
- `python2` is nowadays outdated. It is not recommended using it for new projects.


Van Rossum designed Python as a "Computer Programming Language for Everybody".



## What is Python? {.unnumbered}

- Python is an **interpreted** language compared to compiled languages *e.g.*, C or C++.

- Python is **often slower** compared to compiled languages.

- Python has **dynamic type checking** and **garbage collection**.

- Python supports both **object-oriented** and **functional programming**.

- Python is a **high-level language**, meaning it is closer to human language than the machine language understood by computers.

### Simplified Scheme how Python works internally: {.unnumbered}

If you execute a python program, the python interpreter will convert the code into byte code and then the byte code will be executed by the python virtual machine (PVM).

## Use AI to learn Python {.unnumbered}

:::{.callout-important}

- Language Models like GPT-3 can help you to learn Python.
- Today it is not always necessary to learn the syntax of a programming language by hard.
- You can use AI tools to help you with the syntax and concentrate on the problem-solving part.

- **Learn how to prompt** your problem to the AI and get a proper solution.
- But **be aware** that the AI is **not perfect** and can give you **wrong solutions**.
- So it is **important** that you can **understand the code** and can debug it.
- AI is only a tool not a replacement for a human.

## Practice, Practice, Practice {.unnumbered}

:::{.callout-important}
As it is with languages, you can only learn it if you **practice** it. <br>
So, start you own projects and have fun with it!
