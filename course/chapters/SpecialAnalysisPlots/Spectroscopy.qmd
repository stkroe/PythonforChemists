##   Spectroscopy Data Analysis {.unnumbered}


Spectroscopy is one of the most used experimental techniques in chemistry *e.g.*:

- UV/Vis spectroscopy
- IR spectroscopy
- NMR spectroscopy
- Mass spectroscopy


The analysis of spectroscopy needs often some preprocessing steps *e.g.*:

- Baseline correction
- Smoothing
- Normalization
- Peak assignment
- Peak fitting
- Peak integration
- Peak deconvolution


### Baseline Correction {.unnumbered}

A baseline correction is often needed to remove background noise from the signal and 

The baseline correction can be done by different methods *e.g.*:

- Polynomial fitting
