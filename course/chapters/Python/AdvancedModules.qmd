# Advanced Modules {.unnumbered}

## Scipy {.unnumbered}

Scipy is a library that builds on Numpy. It is specialized in **scientific computing**. It includes modules for statistical calculations, optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and more.

More information can be found at the [Scipy website](https://www.scipy.org/).

Later on we will see how to use Scipy for statistical calculations and for analysis of spectra.

## Scikit-learn {.unnumbered}

Scikit-learn is a library for **machine learning**. It includes modules for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection and preprocessing.

More information can be found at the [Scikit-learn website](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

Later on we will see how to use Scikit-learn for classification and regression.

## Seaborn {.unnumbered}

Seaborn is a library for **data visualization**. It is based on Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

More information can be found at the [Seaborn website](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).

Later on we will see how to use Seaborn for data visualization.
