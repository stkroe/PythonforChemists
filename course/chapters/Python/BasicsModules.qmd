# Numpy and Pandas {.unnumbered}


## Numpy {.unnumbered}
- Numpy is the most important library for Python. 
- The standard data types in Python are very slow and not very efficient for data analysis. 
- Numpy is based mainly on C an C++. 
- This allows Numpy to be faster than plain Python. 
- With Numpy a new data type is introduced `numpy array`. 
- Numpy arrays are multidimensional arrays that are much faster than Python lists. 
- The libary also includes many mathematical functions and methods for linear algebra. 


# More information can found at the [Numpy website](https://numpy.org/).


# Load the required libraries

```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
```

###  Numpy Arrays {.unnumbered}


# An array can be described as multidimensional lists. For example a matrix is a 2D array.

```{pyodide}
mat = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print(mat)
```

# The elements of an array can be accessed using the index of the element. 

```{pyodide}
print(mat[0, 0])   # 1 element at row 0, column 0
```

print(mat[1, 2])  # 6 element at row 1, column 2


print(mat[:, 0])  # [1 4 7] all elements in column 0


print(mat[1, :])  # [4 5 6] all elements in row 1
```

```{pyodide}
empty_mat = np.empty((3,3),dtype=float)
print(empty_mat)
```

```{pyodide}
ones_mat = np.ones((3, 3))
print(ones_mat)
```

```{pyodide}
zeros_mat = np.zeros((3, 3))
print(zeros_mat)
```

```{pyodide}
arr = np.arange(1, 10, 2) # an array from 1 to 10 with a step of 2
print(arr)
```

```{pyodide}
arr2 = np.linspace(0,100,5) # an array from 0 to 100 with 5 elements
print(arr2)
```
```{pyodide}
rand_mat = np.random.rand(3,3) # a 3x3 matrix with random numbers between 0 and 1
print(rand_mat)
```




## Pandas {.unnumbered}


- Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis. 
- It is built on top of Numpy. 
- With Pandas you are working with dataframes and not with arrays like in Numpy. 
- Dataframes are two-dimensional labeled data structures with columns of potentially different types.
- It is like a table in a database or a spreadsheet. Pandas has a lot of methods to manipulate dataframes. 
- You can select subsets of the data, filter, sort, group, merge, join, etc. 
- You can statistically analyze the data, export the data to different file formats, but also plot the data with the help of `matplotlib`.


# More information can be found under [Pandas website](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

```{pyodide}
import pandas as pd
```




### Panda DataFrames {.unnumbered}


# Panda DataFrames are two-dimensional labeled data structures with columns of potentially different types like a table.

```{pyodide}
data = pd.DataFrame({"gas": ["CH4", "H2O", "CO2"], "moalar_weight": [16, 18, 44]
                     }) # create a dataframe from a dictionary
print(data)
```
