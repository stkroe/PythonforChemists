### Hypothesis Testing  {.unnumbered}


Hypothesis testing is a statistical method for making decisions or inferences about a population based on a sample. It is widely used in chemistry and materials science to validate experimental results and compare datasets.

- **Null & Alternative Hypothesis:** The null hypothesis (H₀) assumes no effect, while the alternative hypothesis (H₁) suggests a significant difference.
- **t-tests:** Used to compare the means of two groups (one-sample, independent, paired t-tests).
- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** Compares means of multiple groups to check for significant differences.
- **Chi-square Test:** Used for categorical data to examine associations between different groups.



```python
from scipy import stats

# Example: Comparing two material compositions
group1 = [10.2, 14.5, 13.3, 9.8, 12.7]
group2 = [9.5, 13.1, 12.9, 8.7, 11.3]

# Perform t-test
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(group1, group2)
print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat}, P-value: {p_value}")
```
