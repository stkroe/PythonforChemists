### Hypothesis Testing  {.unnumbered}


Hypothesis testing is a statistical method for making decisions or inferences about a population based on a sample. It is widely used in chemistry and materials science to validate experimental results and compare datasets.

- **Null & Alternative Hypothesis:** The null hypothesis (H₀) assumes no effect, while the alternative hypothesis (H₁) suggests a significant difference.
- **t-tests:** Used to compare the means of two groups (one-sample, independent, paired t-tests).
- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** Compares means of multiple groups to check for significant differences.
- **Chi-square Test:** Used for categorical data to examine associations between different groups.



#### One-Sample t-test
```python
from scipy import stats

# Example: Comparing two material compositions
group1 = [10.2, 14.5, 13.3, 9.8, 12.7]
group2 = [9.5, 13.1, 12.9, 8.7, 11.3]

# Perform t-test
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(group1, group2)
print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat}, P-value: {p_value}")
```

#### ANOVA Test

```{python}
from scipy import stats

# Example: Comparing multiple groups
group1 = [10.2, 14.5, 13.3, 9.8, 12.7]
group2 = [9.5, 13.1, 12.9, 8.7, 11.3]
group3 = [11.2, 15.1, 14.3, 10.8, 13.7]

# Perform ANOVA test
f_stat, p_value = stats.f_oneway(group1, group2, group3)
print(f"F-statistic: {f_stat}, P-value: {p_value}")
```


### Chi-square Test

```{python}
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Example: Comparing categorical data
observed = [[10, 20, 30], [6, 9, 17]]
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(observed)
print(f"Chi-square: {chi2}, P-value: {p}")
