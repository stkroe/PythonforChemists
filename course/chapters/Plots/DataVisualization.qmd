# Data Visualization {.unnumbered}



Visualization of data helps us to understand the data better and communicate the results.
It is easier to understand a graph than a table of numbers.

## Which technique should you use? {.unnumbered}


- How many variables do you have and how many do you want to compare at once?
- What type of data do you have?
- What type of relationship are you trying to represent?
- Do you want to analyze the distribution of the data?
- Do you want to analyze the correlation between the variables?
- Do you want to show ranking or ordering of the data?
- Do you want to a trend over time?
- Do you want to show the composition of the data?
- Do you want to predict the future values of the data?
- Do you want to show the relationship between the variables?


### Additional resources {.unnumbered}

A good handbook for data visualization in Python is the book ["Python Data Science Handbook" by Jake VanderPlas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.00-introduction-to-matplotlib.html)

## How you should visualize data? {.unnumbered}


- A graphic should have a suitable font size.
- Choose colors that are easy to distinguish also for colorblind people (e.g. [colorbrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/).
- The axis ticks and limits should be chosen in a way that the data is easy to read.
- Axis should be labeled and physical units should be not forgotten.
- The graphic should be not overloaded with information.
- Have always in mind who is the target audience of your graphic and where the graphic will be presented *e.g.* in a scientific paper, in a presentation or in a poster.
