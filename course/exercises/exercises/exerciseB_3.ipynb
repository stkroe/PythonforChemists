    "$$ y(T) = y_0 e^{-\\frac{E_A}{RT}} $$ \n",

    "with $y_0$ being the pre-exponential factor, R and T are the molar gas constant (8.3145 J mol$^{-1}$ K $^{-1}$) and temperature, respectively.\n",

    "One potential option to obtain $E_A$ is a non-linear exponential fit, but this is known to be less reliable than its linear counterpart!\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, Mr. [Svante Arrhenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_Arrhenius) used a linearization of the equation, which in case of the diffusion coefficient looks like this: \n",

    "$$ ln(D) = ln(D_0) - \\frac{E_A}{R}\\frac{1}{T} $$\n",
