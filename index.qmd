## Prequisits
It is suggested that you have a basic understanding of Python or a comparable programming language prior to enrollment in this course, in order to facilitate more expeditious progress. Nevertheless, this course is structured in such a way that it can be done with any prior knowledge. The course contains also a fundamental introduction to Python syntax, and as such, persons with no prior knowledge should be able to take the courses. However, it is advisable to study a basic Python course beside of this content.

Further this course will not going in detail of fundamental statistical principles. This is assumed as fullfilled prequirements beforehand of this course.

## Who is the course for? {.unnumbereds}

This course has been designed for persons who are looking to undertake a specialised data visualization and analyzing course in Python with a particular focus the field of chemistry and materials science. The course tries to be interactivley with practical examples.

## What can you expect from this course {.unnumbered}

- This course wants to show you the advantage of using a programming language for data analyzing and visualization in chemistry and material science in comparision to gui-based softwares.
- The course will give you a very brief introduction to Python and its libraries.
- The main focus will be on the libraries `numpy`, `pandas`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data analyzing and visualization.
- The course is organized interactivly. You will get the chance to practice with exercises.
- Upon successful completion of this course, participants will have acquired a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental components of Python and the key packages necessary for the analysis and presentation of their own research data.
- You can test your knowledge by an exam example at the end of this course.

## What can you NOT expect from this course {.unnumbered}
- You will not get a deep explanation of the Python language. Please consider full Python tutorials for get a deep overview of Python.
- You will not learn object-oriented programming in Python.
- We will not go into details of the libraries.
- This is not a statistics course. 

The aim of this course should be that you get an idea how Python can be use for data analyzing and visualization in chemistry and material science field. 



## How this course is working
This course is divided into three possible paths how to accomplish this course.
Most chapters are containing an introduction for every one, a beginner, an advanced and a challenging section.
If you have no or only very vague knowledge than please follow the beginner path otherwise the advanced path. 
If you want to really challenge you try also the challenging parts.

- The beginner path concentrates on first contact in python.
- In the advanced path you get a deeper dive into different libaries and specialized visualization plots.
- The challenging part is for those who wants to explore advanced topics and complex data visualization techniques. This path will challenge you with more difficult exercises and in-depth analysis.

Every chapter provides examples related to chemistry and material science.
At the end of each part, there are exercises to test your understanding and reinforce the concepts learned. These exercises are designed to be practical and relevant to real-world scenarios in chemistry and materials science.

## Comprehensive Exam

At the very end of the course, there is a comprehensive exam which covers a complete data analyis and visualization example.
