## Prequisits {.unnumbered}
It is suggested that you have a basic understanding of Python or a comparable programming language prior to enrollment in this course, in order to facilitate more expeditious progress. Nevertheless, this course is structured in such a way that it can be done with any prior knowledge. The course contains also a fundamental introduction to Python syntax, and as such, persons with no prior knowledge should be able to take the courses. However, it is advisable to study a basic Python course beside of this content.

Further this course will not going in detail of fundamental statistical principles. This is assumed as fullfilled prequirements beforehand of this course.

## Who is the course for? {.unnumbereds}

This course has been designed for persons who are looking to undertake a specialised data visualization and analyzing course in Python with a particular focus the field of chemistry and materials science. The course tries to be interactivley with practical examples.

## What can you expect from this course {.unnumbered}

- This course wants to show you the advantage of using a programming language for data analyzing and visualization in chemistry and material science in comparision to gui-based softwares.
- The course will give you a very brief introduction to Python and its libraries.
- The main focus will be on the libraries `numpy`, `pandas`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data analyzing and visualization.
- The course is organized interactivly. You will get the chance to practice with exercises.
- Upon successful completion of this course, you will have acquired a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental components of Python and the key packages necessary for the analysis and presentation of their own research data.
- You can test your knowledge by an exam example at the end of this course.

---

## What can you NOT expect from this course {.unnumbered}
- You will not get a deep explanation of the Python language. Please consider full Python tutorials for get a deep overview of Python.
- You will not learn object-oriented programming in Python.
- We will not go into details of the libraries.
- This is not a statistics course. 

The aim of this course should be that you get an idea how Python can be use for data analyzing and visualization in chemistry and material science field.

## How this course is structured {.unnumbered}

This course is divided into three possible paths to accomplish the learning objectives:

- **Beginner Path**: Focuses on first contact with Python, covering basic concepts and introductory modules.
- **Advanced Path**: Provides a deeper dive into different libraries and specialized visualization plots. [work in progress]
- **Challenging Path**: Explores advanced topics and complex data visualization techniques, with more difficult exercises and in-depth analysis. [TODO]

Each lecture includes examples related to chemistry and material science. At the end of each part, there are exercises to test your understanding and reinforce the concepts learned. These exercises are designed to be practical and relevant to real-world scenarios in chemistry and materials science.

**Comprehensive Exam**

At the very end of the course, there is a comprehensive exam which covers a complete data analyis and visualization example.

:::{.callout-important}
It is recommended to try out every lecture and exercise to get the most out of this course.
You can download each interactive notebook and run it on your local machine or use the provided Google Colab links to run the notebooks in the cloud.
