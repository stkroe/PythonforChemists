Please read the [Terms of Service](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/tos_v5.html) and [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)\n:::\n\n\n# How to install Python locally? {.unnumbered}\n\n\nFundamental Python websites:\n\n\n\n- [Python](https://www.python.org) \n- [Python documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/)\n\n\n## 1. Install Python Interpreter {.unnumbered}\n\n\nYour preferred searching engine is your friend to find the best way to install Python on your system.\nPlease choose that method which is suitable for you.\n\n\nPython can be install by severals ways:\n\n\n\n- directly by [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) official site \n    - the installation guide can be found under [python wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)\n- or via package manager of your os: \n    - *e.g.:* `sudo apt install python` (linux debian) or `brew install python` (macOS)\n- or via [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [wsl](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/wsl/install) ect.\n- or via a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) or [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) python package and environment managers which have a python interpreter on board and are avaiable for Windows, Linux and macOS [my recomendation]\n\n\n\n## Python Package and Environment manager {.unnumbered}\n\n\nThe advantage of using a python package and environment manager is that you have a python interpreter directly on board but you can also directly create different python enviroments and install and remove python packages.\n\n\n### Conda {.unnumbered}\n\n\nThere are differerent `conda`installer:\n(Please pay attention which one is suitable for you ([https://docs.anaconda.com/distro-or-miniconda/](https://docs.anaconda.com/distro-or-miniconda/)).\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nPlease read the [Anaconda Terms of Service FAQs](https://www.anaconda.com/pricing/terms-of-service-faqs) and [Terms of Service](https://legal.anaconda.com/policies/en/)) **not** every case is **free** of use. \n\n:::\n\n\n- [Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) is a comprehensive distribution which includes conda and hundreds of preinstalled packages and tools.\n- [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html) is the light version of it which contains only conda, python interpreter and few fundamental packages\n- [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) minimal installer for conda and using only the community [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) channel\n\n\n\n### Mamba {.unnumbered}\n\n\nAnother python package and environment managers is [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n`mamba` is a reimplementation of `conda`:\n - [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html) is a statically linked version  of `mamba` \n - `mamba`and it at the moment faster than `conda`\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n **Recommondation: *micromamba* ** <br>\n\nInstall it like it is explained under the micromamba documentation:\n- [https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html)\n:::\n\n\nPlease install in one of the above explained ways Python and use your preferred searching enging to get more information.\n\n\n## 2. Set up an environment {.unnumbered}\n\nIt is often very useful to have different python enviroments for different python projects because of the need of different python package versions.\n\nYou can use `conda` or `micromamba` to create different environments. There exists also other virtual environment manager.\n\nIn this course the explaination is restricted to `micromamba` as an example. If you want to use something else there exists tons of information online how to use other programs.\n\n\n\n\n### Micromamba: Most important commands are: {.unnumbered}\n\n\nRead for more detail:  [https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html)\n\n\n\nCreating a new virtual environment:\n\n\n```bash\nmicromamba create --name <myenvname>\n```\n\n\nInstall new packages:\n\n\n```bash\nmicromamba install <packagename>\n```\n\n\nList all environments:\n\n\n```bash\nmicromamba env list\n```\n\n\nActivate an environment:\n\n\n```bash\nmicromamba activate <myenvname>\n```\n\n\nList all packages of this environment:\n\n\n```bash\nmicromamba list\n```\n\n\n## 3. Usefull packages for Data Analyse and Visualization:  {.unnumbered}\n- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) - data visualization library\n- [numpy](https://numpy.org) - numerical library\n- [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) - scientific library\n- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - data manipulation library\n- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html) - data visualization library\n- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - machine learning library\n- [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) - statistical library\n- [jupyter-notebook/jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/) - interactive computing environment\n- [ipykernel](https://pypi.org/project/ipykernel/) - IPython Kernel for Jupyter\n- [pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/tool-recommendations/) - package installer for python instead of conda\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n**Recommendation** <br> \nUse *yml-file* with all needed packages and configurations:\n:::\n\n\nSave this in a *environment.yml* file:\n\n\n\n\n\n ```{yml}\n name: myenv\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\ndependencies:\n  - python=3.12\n  - pandas\n  - numpy\n  - matplotlib\n  - jupyterlab\n  - scikit-learn\n  - scipy\n  - pip\n  - ipykernel\n  - seaborn\n  - statsmodels\n ```\n\n\n\n\n\nand create an environment with this specific packages:\n\n\n```bash\nmicromamba env create -f environment.yml\n```\n\n\nTest your installation by opening the interactive python mode by typing in your terminal (Linux, macOS) / comand prompt (Windows):\n\n\n\n```bash\npython\n``` \n\n\nthen something like this should be opened in your terminal (Linux, macOS) / comand prompt (Windows)\n\n```bash\nPython 3.12.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Oct  4 2024, 15:57:01) [Clang 17.0.6 ] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> \n```\n\n\nthen type:\n\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\n\nIf this works your installation was successful!\n\n\n## 4. Choose an editor {.unnumbered}\n\n\nAfter you installed python successfully you need a editor for writing your Python programs. Technical you could use everything where you can write text but it is not really purposeful. \n\n\nAn editor with syntax highlighting, code completion and debugging is very useful.\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n**Recommendation**: *[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)* \n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Other editors:  {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n - Spyder [https://www.spyder-ide.org/](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)\n - PyCharm (JetBrains) [https://www.jetbrains.com/products/compare/?product=pycharm&product=pycharm-ce](https://www.jetbrains.com/products/compare/?product=pycharm&product=pycharm-ce)\n- Jupyter Notebook [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/) [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)\n- Jupyter Lab [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/) [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) etc.\n\n\n### Python extension for VS Code:  {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n- Python from Microsoft, \n- Pylance from Microsoft \n- and Jupyter from Microsoft (optional it is only needed if you want to use Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code)\n\n\nAlternatively you can use a `Jupyter Notebook` (`*.ipynb`) to execute code.\n\nWrite the code in a cell and execute it by pressing the run button.\n\n**Advantage of using Jupyter Notebooks**:\n-  The code can run cell by cell and the output is directly shown below the cell.\n-  Further you can write text and equations in markdown cells. \n- Jupyter Notebooks can also handle different programming languages like `R`or `Julia`.\n- Therefore it is very popular in the data science community.\n\n\nJupyter Notebooks can be used in `VS Code`, `Jupyter Lab`, `Jupyter Notebook` or `Google Colab`.\n\n\n:::{.callout-information}\n\nIn this course all exercises are provided as Jupyter Notebooks. \n\n:::\n\n\n## 6. Test your setup {.unnumbered}\n\n\n- open your editor \n- open a new file and save this file as helloworld.py\n- write your first test program:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\n- execute your program by using your IDE/Editor \n- or using command line in the terminal (Linux/MacOS) / command prompt under Windows.\n\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/file\npython helloworld.py\n```\n\n\nThe ouput should be: \"Hello World!\".\n\n\nIf you are using Jupyter Notebook you can also write this code in a cell and execute it by pressing the run button.\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=false}\nCongratulations\n**You have successfully set up python!!**\n:::\n\n\nAlternative to local installation: Google Colab {.unnumbered}\n\n\n[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a free cloud service provided by Google. It is based on Jupyter Notebooks and allows you to write and execute Python code in your browser.\n\n\n:::{.callout-information}\nThe use of [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) needs a Google Account.
