For example a matrix is a 2D array.\n\n\n\n\n```{pyodide}\nmat = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\nprint(mat)\n```\n\n\n\n\n# The elements of an array can be accessed using the index of the element. \n\n\n\n\n```{pyodide}\nprint(mat[0, 0])   # 1 element at row 0, column 0\n```\n\n\n\n\nprint(mat[1, 2])  # 6 element at row 1, column 2\n\n\nprint(mat[:, 0])  # [1 4 7] all elements in column 0\n\n\nprint(mat[1, :])  # [4 5 6] all elements in row 1\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\nempty_mat = np.empty((3,3),dtype=float)\nprint(empty_mat)\n```\n\n\n\n\n```{pyodide}\nones_mat = np.ones((3, 3))\nprint(ones_mat)\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\nzeros_mat = np.zeros((3, 3))\nprint(zeros_mat)\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\narr = np.arange(1, 10, 2) # an array from 1 to 10 with a step of 2\nprint(arr)\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\narr2 = np.linspace(0,100,5) # an array from 0 to 100 with 5 elements\nprint(arr2)\n```\n\n```{pyodide}\nrand_mat = np.random.rand(3,3) # a 3x3 matrix with random numbers between 0 and 1\nprint(rand_mat)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Pandas {.unnumbered}\n\n\n- Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis. \n- It is built on top of Numpy. \n- With Pandas you are working with dataframes and not with arrays like in Numpy. \n- Dataframes are two-dimensional labeled data structures with columns of potentially different types.\n- It is like a table in a database or a spreadsheet. Pandas has a lot of methods to manipulate dataframes. \n- You can select subsets of the data, filter, sort, group, merge, join, etc. \n- You can statistically analyze the data, export the data to different file formats, but also plot the data with the help of `matplotlib`.\n\n\n# More information can be found under [Pandas website](https://pandas.pydata.org/).\n\n\n\n\n```{pyodide}\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Panda DataFrames {.unnumbered}\n\n\n# Panda DataFrames are two-dimensional labeled data structures with columns of potentially different types like a table.\n\n\n\n\n```{pyodide}\ndata = pd.DataFrame({\"gas\": [\"CH4\", \"H2O\", \"CO2\"], \"moalar_weight\": [16, 18, 44]\n                     }) # create a dataframe from a dictionary\nprint(data)\n```\n\n",
